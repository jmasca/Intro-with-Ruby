x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

Solution: x will be 3. There is no error message.


y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

Solution: x will not be displayed. There will be an error message.
	  The error message will be because variables inside of the block
	  are not accessible outside of the block. Variables outside of the block,
	  however, are accessible inside the block. Hence, why example 1 worked.
