Exercise 6:

Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?



Solution: 

my_hash is created with the key x, as a symbol, whereas
my_hash2 is created with the variable x as a key, which contains the string "hi there".
