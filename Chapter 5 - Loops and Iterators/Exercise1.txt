What does the each method in the following program return after it is finished executing?
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x.each do |a|
  a + 1
end



Solution: The 'each' method will return the original collection of elements it was called on.
	  This is the same as the 'for' loop.
	  In this example, what is returned will be: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
