Exercise 5:

When you run the following code...

def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
end

equal_to_four(5)

You get the following error message..

exercise.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end



Solution:

We get this error because we're missing the 'end' keyword to close the 'if' statement.
Technically, the 'end' in this code is applying itself to the 'if' statement and we need an
additional 'end' to close the method definition, but spacing/alignment-wise it appears the
coder forgot about the 'end' for the 'if' statement. 

Either way, we can fix this error message by providing another 'end' statement:

def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
  end
end
