Exercise 7:

What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?



Solution:
	The main difference between an Array and a Hash are the way that the two are indexed.
	An Array is indexed with integers starting at zero, whereas a Hash is indexed by keys.
	The Array is referenced by its index number and the Hash is referenced by its key-value pair.
